## Hosting

I host this on a Mac Mini hooked up to a 1gig symetrical fiber connection. It uses [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) to get on the internet. I highly recomend this configuration. It has been the easiest way to be able to develop and have the results instantly on the internet. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.9. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
